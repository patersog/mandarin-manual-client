# Mandarin Manual Client

The mandarin manual is a learning tool that utilize spaced-repetition learning algorithms to teach users basic mandarin phrases and words.

Spaced repetition works by repeatedly showing you questions that you do not know the answer to, in the hopes that you will eventually remember the correct answer, so that you can move on to new material.

The more you answer questions correctly, the more you will be able to learn!ðŸ’ª

Whether traveling in a new land, or meeting a new friend ðŸ˜‰, we hope that the Mandarin Manual will serve(r) you well.
